Our interest group was founded in 2023 by Clare Patterson, Marian Marchal, and Vinicius Macuch Silva.

**Clare Patterson**

**Marian Marchal**

I'm a PhD student at Saarland University in Vera Demberg's lab. My work focuses on the role of relational and contextual cues in processing discourse relations, but I am interested in anything remotely related to this. In my research, I often combine various psycholinguistic tasks (e.g. self-paced reading, comprehension) to test my hypotheses. These hypotheses are often inspired by corpus research and cognitive models of language processing.

**Vinicius Macuch Silva**

Vinicius is a post-doctoral researcher working with Bodo Winter at the Department of English Language and Linguistics, University of Birmingham.

He's interested in how people use language to create and manage meaning in communication, both when interacting with others and when producing and interpreting language in various other settings. In his research he uses primarily quantitative empirical methods, including controlled experimentation as well as computational and corpus analysis, to investigate issues related to pragmatic inferencing, strategic communication, argumentation and stance-taking, as well as expressive and affective meaning.
