Marian Marchal

I am a PhD student at Saarland University in Vera Demberg's lab. My work focuses on the role of relational and contextual cues in processing discourse relations, but I am interested in anything remotely related to this. In my research, I try to combine various methodologies: I conduct corpus research and psycholinguistic experiments, in which I use both on-line and off-line tasks.
