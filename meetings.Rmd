## Upcoming meetings

### October 18 - 16:00-16:50 CEST
**[Chris Cummins](https://www.crcummins.com/)**, ***University of Edinburgh***

**Psychic linguistics?**

Readers of experimental linguistics papers can occasionally be struck by a curious sensation. Based on what’s in the methods section, you don’t know whether a particular manipulation will make a difference to the outcome variable (say, response time), or in which direction it will shift if so. But when you look at the full lists of stimuli, you suddenly develop a strong sense of what’s going to happen, and that premonition comes true upon reading the rest of the paper.

In this talk I use this idea briefly to discuss three points: whether we’re allowed to ‘accidentally’ introduce confounds in our materials; how the main-text examples in a paper relate to what’s in the appendix; and under what circumstances it’s really necessary to leave the armchair and actually run a study.

### November 15 - 14:00-14:50 CET
