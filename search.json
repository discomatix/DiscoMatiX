Our group is specifically focused on the interface between theoretical and empirical approaches.\r\nWhat?\r\nWe bring together interested researchers in the fields of discourse and pragmatics to exchange ideas and experiences. Through these encounters, we aim to:\r\ncritically assess the (in)compatibility of different theoretical frameworks in the field of discourse and pragmatics\r\ndevelop best practices for empirically testing theoretical predictions in ecologically valid and theoretically stringent tasks\r\nOur first step is an on-line series, in which invited speakers discuss issues related to the above topics and researchers will have the opportunity to engage in discussion.\r\nWhy?\r\nThe field of discourse and pragmatics is characterized by many different frameworks (i.e. Neo- and Post-Gricean pragmatics, discourse representation theories, RSA, etc.). We believe that empirical approaches can help to further develop these theories, but applying well-known psycholinguistic techniques in this area is challenging for two reasons: first, the gap between abstract theoretical constructs and testable predictions is large; second, the contextual nature of discourse and pragmatics is difficult to implement with experimental paradigms that have been optimized for word- and sentence processing. Plausible communicative contexts are crucial for eliciting natural pragmatic behavior and generalizing our findings, but negatively influences the experimental control crucial for replicability. Through this interest group, we hope to contribute to aligning different frameworks and enhancing experimental approaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

To join these sessions, please send an email to ‘discomatix [dot] group [at] gmail [dot] com’.\r\nUpcoming meetings\r\nOctober 18 - 16:00-16:50 CEST\r\nChris Cummins, University of Edinburgh\r\nChris Cummins is a Reader in Linguistics and English Language at the University of Edinburgh. His research is mostly in experimental semantics and pragmatics, focusing on why speakers choose to use particular linguistic forms, and how hearers interpret this.\r\nIn his ongoing work, he’s continuing to explore how we communicate about quantity, as well as how we make decisions based on our understanding of what a speaker has told us, for instance in high-stakes domains such as financial and medical interactions. He’s particularly interested in how we infer additional features of the situation, such as the speaker’s knowledge state and potentially their argumentative agenda, from the utterance, and how this feeds into decision-making.\r\nAbstract\r\nAvailable soon.\r\nNovember 15 - 16:00-16:50 CET\r\nIngmar Brilmayer, University of Cologne\r\nIngmar Brilmayer is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cologne’s Xlinc Lab on the project “Communication Electrified” (Volkswagen Stiftung). There he has built a lab which combines mobile EEG and eye-tracking recordings in naturalistic interactions. His research interests are in the neurobiological basis of language processing and in neuropsychological correlates of referential processes in natural settings, as well as individual differences and predictive processes that underpin language processing.\r\nAbstract\r\nAvailable soon.\r\nDecember 6 - 16:00-16:50 CET\r\nVera Demberg, Saarland University\r\nVera Demberg is a Professor of Computer Science and Computational Linguistics at Saarland University.\r\nShe has been working on discourse and pragmatics with her team in both the SFB1102 ‘Information Density and Linguistic Encoding’ as well as the ERC-funded ‘Individualized Interaction in Discourse’.\r\nIn her research, she combines both experimental and computational approaches to discourse and pragmatics in order to develop cognitive models of human language understanding.\r\nAbstract\r\nAvailable soon.\r\nPast meetings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nOur interest group was founded in 2023 by Clare Patterson, Marian Marchal, and Vinicius Macuch Silva.\r\nClare Patterson\r\nI’m a postdoctoral researcher at the CRC Prominence in Language in Cologne, Germany. My research interests are in the processing of sentence and discourse-level phenomena related to coherence such as anaphora and discourse connectives. I’ve used offline and online experimental methods, including self-paced reading and eye-tracking, to investigate various aspects of anaphora resolution both in first-language users and in adult second-language learners. I’m also interested in how our findings can be modelled using Bayesian frameworks, how we can investigate other discourse-level phenomena using more naturalistic experimental paradigms, and how to combine these with corpus and modelling approaches.\r\nMarian Marchal\r\nI’m a PhD student at Saarland University in Vera Demberg’s lab. My work focuses on the role of relational and contextual cues in processing discourse relations, but I am interested in anything remotely related to this. In my research, I often combine various psycholinguistic tasks (e.g. self-paced reading, comprehension) to test my hypotheses. These hypotheses are often inspired by corpus research and cognitive models of language processing.\r\nVinicius Macuch Silva\r\nVinicius is a post-doctoral researcher working with Bodo Winter at the Department of English Language and Linguistics, University of Birmingham.\r\nHe’s interested in how people use language to create and manage meaning in communication, both when interacting with others and when producing and interpreting language in various other settings. In his research he uses primarily quantitative empirical methods, including controlled experimentation as well as computational and corpus analysis, to investigate issues related to pragmatic inferencing, strategic communication, argumentation and stance-taking, as well as expressive and affective meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
