Our group is specifically focused on the interface between theoretical and empirical approaches.\r\nWhat?\r\nWe bring together interested researchers in the fields of discourse and pragmatics to exchange ideas and experiences. Through these encounters, we aim to:\r\ncritically assess the (in)compatibility of different theoretical frameworks in the field of discourse and pragmatics\r\ndevelop best practices for empirically testing theoretical predictions in ecologically valid and theoretically stringent tasks\r\nOur first step is an on-line series, in which invited speakers discuss issues related to the above topics and researchers will have the opportunity to engage in discussion (see Meetings).\r\nWhy?\r\nEmpirical research in this field is difficult for two reasons:\r\nfirst, there is a gap between theoretical constructs and testable predictions\r\nsecond, there is a tension between the contextual nature of discourse and pragmatics and experimental control\r\nFor more information, read our Mission statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

To join these sessions, please send an email to ‘discomatix [dot] group [at] gmail [dot] com’.\r\nUpcoming meetings\r\nOctober 18 - 16:00-16:50 CEST\r\nChris Cummins, University of Edinburgh\r\nPsychic linguistics?\r\nReaders of experimental linguistics papers can occasionally be struck by a curious sensation. Based on what’s in the methods section, you don’t know whether a particular manipulation will make a difference to the outcome variable (say, response time), or in which direction it will shift if so. But when you look at the full lists of stimuli, you suddenly develop a strong sense of what’s going to happen, and that premonition comes true upon reading the rest of the paper.\r\nIn this talk I use this idea briefly to discuss three points: whether we’re allowed to ‘accidentally’ introduce confounds in our materials; how the main-text examples in a paper relate to what’s in the appendix; and under what circumstances it’s really necessary to leave the armchair and actually run a study.\r\nNovember 15 - 14:00-14:50 CET\r\nIngmar Brilmayer, University of Cologne\r\nCombined eyetracking and EEG in an interactive setting: perspective-taking, decision making and action selection\r\nThe ability to adopt another person’s perspective is a fundamental social skill, crucial for various aspects of daily interaction. Research has explored the cognitive mechanisms involved in perspective-taking, revealing its dependence on factors like linguistic context, task, culture, and cognitive resources. However, the definition of perspective-taking behavior remains ambiguous in the literature. Currently, the absence of measurable effects is often interpreted as evidence for perspective-taking.\r\nThis study challenges this assumption by simultaneously investigating gaze patterns and electroencephalographic (EEG) data in a real-world director task. In the first study, participants faced common ground conflicts involving size-contrasted objects, with eye-tracking results showing an increased number of looks to competitor objects in conflict trials and a reduced number of looks to target objects. Event-related potentials (ERP) showed a significant P300 effect in conflict trials over posterior channels and a simultaneous frontal negativity.\r\nThe second study aimed to reduce cognitive load by reducing the number of objects and by using identical objects as hidden competitors, revealing that participants primarily fixated on the director’s face, then the target, and finally the empty (target-)compartment, while (almost) completely ignoring the competitors. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between conditions, with a higher number of looks to the target in the conflict condition - the reverse of study 1. The same holds true for the ERP data: a frontal positivity and a posterior negativity following common ground conflicts - again the reverse as compared to study 1.\r\nThe findings propose a continuum of cognitive and action-oriented strategies in perspective-taking, influenced by available information and cognitive resources. Gaze patterns in designs akin to the director task might reflect evidence accumulation for referential decisions and attention orienting, mirrored in the P300 ERP component, which is sensitive to or marks cognition-action transitions. This challenges the simplistic interpretation of gaze behavior as a direct indicator of perspective-taking, and emphasizes the role of multimodal cognitive processes involved in perspective taking during the director task.\r\nDecember 6 - 16:00-16:50 CET\r\nVera Demberg, Saarland University\r\nAbstract\r\nAvailable soon.\r\nPast meetings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nUnder construction\r\nThe field of discourse and pragmatics is characterized by many different frameworks (i.e. Neo- and Post-Gricean pragmatics, theories of discourse structure, information theoretic approaches, etc.). We believe that empirical data can help to further develop these theories, but applying well-known psycholinguistic techniques in this area is challenging for two reasons: first, the gap between abstract theoretical constructs and testable predictions is large; second, the contextual nature of discourse and pragmatics is difficult to implement with experimental paradigms that have been optimized for word- and sentence processing. Plausible communicative contexts are crucial for eliciting natural pragmatic behavior and generalizing our findings, but negatively influences the experimental control. Through this interest group, we hope to contribute to aligning different frameworks and enhancing experimental approaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nOur interest group was founded in 2023 by Clare Patterson, Marian Marchal, and Vinicius Macuch Silva.\r\nClare Patterson\r\nI’m a postdoctoral researcher at the CRC Prominence in Language in Cologne, Germany. My research interests are in the processing of sentence and discourse-level phenomena related to coherence such as anaphora and discourse connectives. I’ve used offline and online experimental methods, including self-paced reading and eye-tracking, to investigate various aspects of anaphora resolution both in first-language users and in adult second-language learners. I’m also interested in how our findings can be modelled using Bayesian frameworks, how we can investigate other discourse-level phenomena using more naturalistic experimental paradigms, and how to combine these with corpus and modelling approaches.\r\nMarian Marchal\r\nI’m a PhD student at Saarland University in Vera Demberg’s lab. My work focuses on the role of relational and contextual cues in processing discourse relations, but I am interested in anything remotely related to this. In my research, I often combine various psycholinguistic tasks (e.g. self-paced reading, comprehension) to test my hypotheses. These hypotheses are often inspired by corpus research and cognitive models of language processing.\r\nVinicius Macuch Silva\r\nI’m a post-doctoral researcher working with Bodo Winter at the Department of English Language and Linguistics, University of Birmingham.\r\nI’m interested in how people use language to create and manage meaning in communication, both when interacting with others and when producing and interpreting language in various other settings. In my research I use primarily quantitative empirical methods, including controlled experimentation as well as computational and corpus analysis, to investigate issues related to pragmatic inferencing, strategic communication, argumentation and stance-taking, as well as expressive and affective meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
