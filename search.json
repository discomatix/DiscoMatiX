Our group is specifically focused on the interface between theoretical and empirical approaches.\r\nWhat?\r\nWe bring together interested researchers in the fields of discourse and pragmatics to exchange ideas and experiences. Through these encounters, we aim to:\r\ncritically assess the (in)compatibility of different theoretical frameworks in the field of discourse and pragmatics\r\ndevelop best practices for empirically testing theoretical predictions in ecologically valid and theoretically stringent tasks\r\nOur first step is an on-line series, in which invited speakers discuss issues related to the above topics and researchers will have the opportunity to engage in discussion (see Meetings).\r\nWhy?\r\nEmpirical research in this field is difficult for two reasons:\r\nfirst, there is a gap between theoretical constructs and testable predictions\r\nsecond, there is a tension between the contextual nature of discourse and pragmatics and experimental control\r\nFor more information, read our Mission statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In 2024, we will have a special Winter Session in February, followed by a Spring Series, starting in April. You can find our upcoming and past meetings below. To join these sessions, please send an email to ‘discomatix [dot] group [at] gmail [dot] com’.\r\nUpcoming meetings\r\nFebruary 6 - Winter Session\r\nOn Tuesday February 6 (16:00-16:50 CET) we’ll have a special themed session on multimodality in discourse and pragmatics with 5-min flash talks by the speakers below.\r\nAnita Slonimska, Max Planck Institute of Psycholinguistics\r\nRethinking communicative efficiency: Insights from sign languages\r\nJonas Nölle, University of Glasgow\r\nMore than affect: Facial expressions serve as pragmatic signals in multimodal communication\r\nSchuyler Laparle, Tilburg University\r\nThe iconicity of abstract structure: Gesturing discourse relations\r\nSpring series 2024\r\nApril 9 - Nicole Gotzner, Osnabrück University\r\nMay 14 - Panel discussion, more details soon\r\nJune 11 - Tatjana Scheffler, Ruhr-Universität Bochum\r\nPast meetings\r\nAutumn series 2023\r\n\r\nDecember 6 - Vera Demberg, Saarland University\r\nCombining experimental work with computational modelling to better understand pragmatic processing\r\nIn this talk, I will argue that complementing experimental research with computational modelling can be highly beneficial for developing a deeper understanding of pragmatic processing in humans. I will illustrate this claim with an example from current research at our lab, where we investigated how comprehenders adapt to speaker-specific use of uncertainty expressions (e.g., one speaker uses the word “probably” rather generously in situations where the probability of the event is not all that high, vs. another speaker who uses the word “probably” more cautiously). Specifically, we were interested in individual differences between study participants with respect to how strongly they adapt their expectations / interpretations to how they have experienced the two speakers use uncertainty expressions like “probably”. We examined how any differences in adaptation are related to individual differences between participants (working memory updating, reasoning ability, linguistic experience, theory of mind abilities). In the experiment we found a correlation between adaptation strength and abilities in terms of working memory updating as measured by the keep track task. I will discuss our efforts in constructing a computational model of this effect, and what additional questions this exercise brought up.\r\nFor a recording of this talk, send us an email.\r\n\r\nNovember 15 - Ingmar Brilmayer, University of Cologne\r\nCombined eyetracking and EEG in an interactive setting: the what, the why and the wherefore\r\nIn this talk, I will talk about setup, data recording and data analysis in our interactive laboratory in Cologne. In the first part of the talk, I will talk about the requirements for interactive research in terms of hardware and software. In the second part of the talk, I will present two studies that we designed and conducted in our lab, the difficulties with building the experiment, as well as with data analysis that arise from the naturalistic design of the studies. In the last part, I will present results of these experiments, showing that, despite all the difficulties, it is worth the effort.\r\nFor a recording of this talk, send us an email.\r\n\r\nOctober 18 - Chris Cummins, University of Edinburgh\r\nPsychic linguistics?\r\nReaders of experimental linguistics papers can occasionally be struck by a curious sensation. Based on what’s in the methods section, you don’t know whether a particular manipulation will make a difference to the outcome variable (say, response time), or in which direction it will shift if so. But when you look at the full lists of stimuli, you suddenly develop a strong sense of what’s going to happen, and that premonition comes true upon reading the rest of the paper.\r\nIn this talk I use this idea briefly to discuss three points: whether we’re allowed to ‘accidentally’ introduce confounds in our materials; how the main-text examples in a paper relate to what’s in the appendix; and under what circumstances it’s really necessary to leave the armchair and actually run a study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nThe field of discourse and pragmatics is characterized by many different frameworks (i.e. Neo- and Post-Gricean pragmatics, theories of discourse structure, information theoretic approaches, etc.). We believe that empirical data can help to further develop these theories, but applying well-known psycholinguistic techniques in this area is challenging for two reasons: first, the gap between abstract theoretical constructs and testable predictions is large; second, the contextual nature of discourse and pragmatics is difficult to implement with experimental paradigms that have been optimized for word- and sentence processing. Plausible communicative contexts are crucial for eliciting natural pragmatic behavior and generalizing our findings, but negatively influences the experimental control. Through this interest group, we hope to contribute to aligning different frameworks and enhancing experimental approaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nOur interest group was founded in 2023 by Clare Patterson, Marian Marchal, and Vinicius Macuch Silva.\r\nClare Patterson\r\nI’m a postdoctoral researcher at the CRC Prominence in Language in Cologne, Germany. My research interests are in the processing of sentence and discourse-level phenomena related to coherence such as anaphora and discourse connectives. I’ve used offline and online experimental methods, including self-paced reading and eye-tracking, to investigate various aspects of anaphora resolution both in first-language users and in adult second-language learners. I’m also interested in how our findings can be modelled using Bayesian frameworks, how we can investigate other discourse-level phenomena using more naturalistic experimental paradigms, and how to combine these with corpus and modelling approaches.\r\nMarian Marchal\r\nI’m a PhD student at Saarland University in Vera Demberg’s lab. My work focuses on the role of relational and contextual cues in processing discourse relations, but I am interested in anything remotely related to this. In my research, I often combine various psycholinguistic tasks (e.g. self-paced reading, comprehension) to test my hypotheses. These hypotheses are often inspired by corpus research and cognitive models of language processing.\r\nVinicius Macuch Silva\r\nI’m a post-doctoral researcher working with Bodo Winter at the Department of English Language and Linguistics, University of Birmingham.\r\nI’m interested in how people use language to create meaning in communication, both when interacting with others and when producing and interpreting language in various other settings. In my research I use primarily quantitative empirical methods, including controlled experimentation as well as computational and corpus analysis, to investigate issues related to pragmatic inferencing, strategic communication, argumentation and stance-taking, as well as expressive and affective meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
